When the length was 6, there were times in which LinSearch was faster than BinSearch.
As the size increases, the time needed to complete a LinSearch increases.
The target is always going to be size-1, so that it not only serves as a control variable, but it also makes
the code run through the "worse case scenario."
// QCC- How would changing the target affect the time needed to find the target.
// Gallery Tour (only one person was floating around since one other person's location was unable to be located)
BinSearch was faster than LinSearch for all three groups visited, but one group did best case scenario
and it was interesting how LinSearch was faster than BinSearch for every scenario, but it was really short difference.
For random target and worst case target, BinSearch and LinSearch were close for the shorter arrays but
the difference became a lot more apparent when the length of the arrays were increases. LinSearch took a lot longer.
