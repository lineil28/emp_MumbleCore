1. get test cases
2. run binary and linear search on it, timing it with currenttimemillis()
3. record time and get an average, good data

new plaN?
1. make test case
2. make variable that takes the value of the current time
3. run linear search
4. make another variable that takes the bal of currentitmemillis()
5. repeat for binary search
6. make analyziziiations and coolio

even better plan!?
1. grasp currentTimeMillis() and use it to create some sort of testing method
2. have a Comparable array thats When the size will be determined by the input of the tester.
3. get a number of "trials" which was the number of times <code>BinSearch</code> or <code>LinSearch</code> will search for the target, which will be a random int using <code>SIZE*Math.random()</code>.
4. record the time needed to find the target <code>TRIALS</code> amount of times. 
5. Do these tests for numerous sizes. 
6. analyze.
